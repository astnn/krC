This exercise is solved in the folder ./ch5/expr/.

It is an augmented version of the polish calculator as found in ./ch4/pcalc/.
The main changes from the original pcalc is that input are read from the
commandline arguments into a buffer, instead of being read from stdin. This is
done as the first action in main.
The buffered input is then passed to getch by calling the new getarg() instead
of getchar().
All new functions are stored in arghandler.c,
