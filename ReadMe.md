This repository holds my attempts at solving the exercises of Kernighan and
Ritchie's "The C Programming Language", second edition.

The code has been compiled with the latest version of the gcc-compiler and
tested on a system running GNU/LINUX. Besides some user information (e.g. how
to enter an EOL-character into the terminal) it should run on Windows without
further complications.

All code in this repository is made available under a GNU GPL-3.0 (or later)
license. Anyone is free to use, modify, and redistribute the code under the
terms of the license.
The full license is available in the file "COPYING" at the root of the
repository.
