This repository holds my attempts at solving the exercises of Kernighan and
Ritchie's "The C Programming Language", second edition.

The code has been compiled with the latest version of the gcc-compiler (default
optimisation level) and tested on a system running GNU/LINUX. Besides some user
information (e.g. how to enter an EOL-character into the terminal) it should run
on Windows without further complications.

The code is ordered as follows:
-A folder is created for each chapter in which exercises have been solved.
-The exercises are saved as ex##.c (if it is a codding exercise).
-Example: Exercise 5 of Chapter 3 would be found at the path: "ch3/ex05.c".
-In case of multiple solutions to the same exercise, they are appended with "_#"
  to differentiate them.

All code in this repository is made available under a GNU GPL-3.0 (or later)
license. Anyone is free to use, modify, and redistribute the code under the
terms of the license.
The full license is available in the file "COPYING" at the root of the
repository.
