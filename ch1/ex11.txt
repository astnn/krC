Question: How would you test the word count program? What kind of inputs are
most likely to uncover bugs, if any?

Answer: Create unit tests. Corner-cases are most likely to cause errors. This
could beinputs with:
  No words (blanks, tabs, newlines),
  Large amount of words (tricker an overflow?),
  Only non-words,
  One word, but no non-words.
